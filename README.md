# A Bad Ethereum contract

I just created a bad contract to bug hunt in the [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/) tool.

This is my harrowing tale...

So, if you install Manticore, cd into this project directory and run:

`manticore bad_contract.sol`

and you will get some pkl files. It's a symbolic execution tool, which is really fascinating. I highly suggest checking it out.
